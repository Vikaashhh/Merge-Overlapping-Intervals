# 🚀 Day 24 - Overlapping Intervals (GFG 160 Days DSA Challenge)

## 🧠 Problem Statement:
You are given a 2D array `arr[][]` where each element represents an interval in the form `[start, end]`.

## **Task:**  
Merge all overlapping intervals and return the result.

---

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(N log N) (due to sorting)

Space Complexity: O(N) (for storing the result)

---
## 📌 Concepts Used:
Sorting

Greedy Merging

List Operations
